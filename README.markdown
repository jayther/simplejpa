#Jayther's SimpleJPA Fork#
**Note**: this is more for myself so it's easy for me to work with JPA-style configurations.

Improvements include only depending on member fields, splitting long strings to multiple attribute/value pairs (from https://github.com/appoxy/simplejpa/pull/5 , adapted to work in SimpleJPA's more recent changes), and serialize objects into Base64 strings (which also use the long string split feature).

**WARNING**: Foreign keys and Lobs support are removed for now to remove dependencies on beans and enhancers. Will re-add support when I have time.

**WARNING**: There are some commented/removed code in the tests. Will add proper tests for the major changes.

##Introduction##
Here's how to get started using SimpleJPA.

##Dependencies##
Starting with version 1.5 SimpleJPA switched to use Amazon's Java SDK. Use the latest releases of (I'll try to package these up into the release if I can figure out the licensing compatability):

*	commons-lang - You can grab all commons libs at http://commons.apache.org/downloads/index.html
*	commons-collections
*	commons-logging
*	commons-codec
*	cglib-nodep
*	kitty-cache
*	ehcache
*	scannotation
*	javassist (required for scannotation)
*	ejb3-persistence-api
*	AWS SDK for Java
*	Apache HttpClient

When building from source and using the Maven pom.xml file Kitty-cache will need to be added explicitly as a reference.

Dependencies for versions pre 1.5

*	commons-lang - You can grab all commons libs at http://commons.apache.org/downloads/index.html
*	commons-beanutils
*	commons-collections
*	commons-logging (required for jets3t)
*	commons-codec (required for jets3t)
*	Apache HttpClient - (required for jets3t)
*	typica
*	jets3t
*	cglib-nodep - http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56933
*	ejb3-persistence-api - http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/org/hibernate/ejb3-persistence/1.0.2.GA/
*	scannotation - http://scannotation.sourceforge.net/
*	javassist (scannotation) - http://www.csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~chiba/javassist/
*	kitty-cache - http://code.google.com/p/kitty-cache/
*	ehcache - http://ehcache.org/


##Setup##
Create a file called simplejpa.properties and put on the classpath. Add your Amazon access key and secret key like:

	accessKey = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	secretKey = SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
	
For more configuration options, see Configuration.

Now the Code
Create an EntityManagerFactory
// Create EntityManagerFactory. This should be a global object that you reuse.
private static EntityManagerFactoryImpl factory = new EntityManagerFactoryImpl("persistenceUnitName", null);
Get EntityManager's from the Factory
// Get an EntityManager from the factory. This is a short term object that you'll use for some processing then throw away
EntityManager em = factory.createEntityManager();
##Persisting an object##
Lets create a very simple object to store.

	@Entity
	public class MyTestObject {
		@Id
		private String id;
		private String name;

		public String getId() {
			return id;
		}

		public void setId(String id) {
			this.id = id;
		}
	   
		public void setName(String name) {
			this.name = name;
		}

		public String getName() {
			return name;
		}

	}
Now to persist it:

	MyObject ob = new MyObject();
	ob.setName("Scooby doo");
	em.persist(ob);
	
That's it!

##Querying##
See JPAQuery

##Deleting##
	MyObject ob...
	em.remove(ob);
Close the EntityManager when you're done
This is done after you've completed a set of tasks, such as displaying a web page. It ensures that caches get cleaned up and no memory gets wasted.

	em.close();
Close the EntityManagerFactory before you shutdown your app
	factory.close();
##What Next?##
See all the JPA features currently supported.
Cast your EntityManager to SimpleEntityManager to get more advanced features like asynchronous operations.
